# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repository contains the final course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera. It is meant to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean data with the use of an R script called `run_analysis.R` that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
## Files
`CodeBook.md` modifies and updates the different codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

`run_analysis.R` has the code which comprises our course project, with the 5 steps included in the heading above.

`Tidy.txt` contains our second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
